Lovingly recreating iconic album covers using only the power of R, tidyverse and ggplot2.

Ever looked at an iconic album cover and thought "I wonder how that could be recreated using `ggplot2`?". 

No, just me then?

Only 1 album cover currently recreated, but I plan to do more. Suggestions welcome. Or try it yourself.

### Rules of the game:

*  Only standard geoms and aesthetics can be used. Don't just use an image of the album, obviously that would be poor form.
*  Stick to only `ggplot2` if you can. `ggplot2` extension packages may be used, I haven't quite decided yet.
*  No, the 'White Album' by The Beatles doesn't count.

### Album Covers

*  [American Water](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/silver-jews-american-water/) by the Silver Jews. A seminal slice of American indie-rock from 1998 masterminded by David Berman, along with Stephen Malkmus from Pavement.
